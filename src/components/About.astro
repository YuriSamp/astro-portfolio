        <p class='text-lg'>
          Born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, I tried many things before
          discovering programming. As a teenager, my dream was to become a
          professional skater, but it never happened. However, that phase gave
          me many stories and funny moments to tell. When I went to high school,
          I chose to take a technical course in building construction to see if
          I liked it. It was a cool experience, but I didn't pursue it after
          finishing the course. Eventually, when I entered college, I tried to
          study chemistry for 6 months, then switched to economics and studied
          it for a year. During that time, I discovered programming as a hobby
          and ended up liking it so much that I became a programmer today.

          Not everything is about work and programming, in my free time I like
          to listen to music of all genres and consume all possible forms of
          art. In addition, since I was little I have been fascinated with video
          games and how a story can be told in various ways.

        look themselves in the mirror and acknowledge, you know, their own flaws
        and fears and imperfections and put them out there in the open for
        people to relate to it.</q
